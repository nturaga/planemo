# Usage:
#  Run a single conformance test:
#    bash scripts/test_conformance_cwl.bash -n10
#  Run all conformance tests:
#    bash scripts/test_conformance_cwl.bash
#
# This script installs planemo and a Galaxy/planemo cwl-runner implementation
# in the current virtualenv, clones down CWL spec, and runs a configuration test.
# Very few tests will pass - tests which don't have actual data (specify fake jobs)
# will not work, nor will tests which depend on the cwl-runner preserving filenames
# instead of output IDs (this isn't implemented in Galaxy/planemo and I'm not convinced
# it should be), finally any tests of workflows at all or tools using features not
# yet implemented in the CWL will not pass.

set -e
# Ensure working directory is planemo project.
